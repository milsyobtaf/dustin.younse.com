# About Me

Howdy! My name is Dustin. I'm a recovering [Drupalist] currently working as a Design Technologist on the Design System at [Indeed] where we like to say - We help people get jobs!

Before realizing HTML and CSS could pay the bills, I was an aspiring filmmaker who enjoyed the more technical aspects of editing and special effects.

After a few years in Boston, I'm back in Austin, eating all of the tacos I can get my hands on.
