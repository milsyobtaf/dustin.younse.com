# About Me

## Professional life

Howdy! My name is Dustin. I'm a Design Technologist working on the Design System at [Indeed] where we like to say - We help people get jobs! Before finding design systems, I was a [Drupalist] working on Very Large Websitesâ„¢ for media brands and universities you've definitely heard of.

Before realizing HTML and CSS could pay the bills, I was an aspiring filmmaker who enjoyed the more technical aspects of audio / video editing and visual effects.

## The other 128 hours of the week

I'm a lifelong cyclist who has recently rediscovered riding on dirt. I've got a [dentist quality mountain bike][yeti] and a [gravel bike][niner] that isn't quite as fancy, but it still feels like I have wings on the downhills.

I also have a pretty stacked [garage gym][fringesport] where my friends and I lift [heavy things][rogue] and put them back down again. Mostly powerlifting with some strongman aspirations and a dash of HIIT on the weekends to work the beach muscles.

I like to tinker with [Arduino adjacent][ada] electronics and [3d printers][prusa]. When public gatherings were more common, I helped run [dorkbot Austin][dorkbot] for several years and had a part in getting [SXSW Create][sxswcreate] off the ground.

## On the road again

After a few years in Boston, I'm back in Austin, eating all of the tacos I can get my hands on. One of these days, I'm going to buy some land in Vermont or New Mexico with my closest friends and enjoy a pastoral lifestyle with high speed internet.

New England has the best sandwiches, but the Southwest has the best tortilla based foods.
