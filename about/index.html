    <h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Professional life</h2>
<p>Howdy! My name is Dustin. I'm a Design Technologist working on the Design System at <a href="https://indeed.com">Indeed</a> where we like to say - We help people get jobs! Before finding design systems, I was a <a href="https://drupal.org">Drupalist</a> working on Very Large Websitesâ„¢ for media brands and universities you've definitely heard of.</p>
<p>Before realizing HTML and CSS could pay the bills, I was an aspiring filmmaker who enjoyed the more technical aspects of audio / video editing and visual effects.</p>
<h2>The other 128 hours of the week</h2>
<p>I'm a lifelong cyclist who has recently rediscovered riding on dirt. I've got a <a href="https://yeticycles.com">dentist quality mountain bike</a> and a <a href="https://ninerbikes.com">gravel bike</a> that isn't quite as fancy, but it still feels like I have wings on the downhills.</p>
<p>I also have a pretty stacked <a href="https://fringesport.com">garage gym</a> where my friends and I lift <a href="https://roguefitness.com">heavy things</a> and put them back down again. Mostly powerlifting with some strongman aspirations and a dash of HIIT on the weekends to work the beach muscles.</p>
<p>I like to tinker with <a href="https://adafruit.com">Arduino adjacent</a> electronics and <a href="https://prusa3d.com">3d printers</a>. When public gatherings were more common, I helped run <a href="https://dorkbot.org">dorkbot Austin</a> for several years and had a part in getting <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/03/17/sxsw-create-atx-hackerspace-area/">SXSW Create</a> off the ground.</p>
<h2>On the road again</h2>
<p>After a few years in Boston, I'm back in Austin, eating all of the tacos I can get my hands on. One of these days, I'm going to buy some land in Vermont or New Mexico with my closest friends and enjoy a pastoral lifestyle with high speed internet.</p>
<p>New England has the best sandwiches, but the Southwest has the best tortilla based foods.</p>
